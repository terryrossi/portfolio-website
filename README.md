# Portfolio Website

Responsive Portfolio Website. This project was generated with HTML/CSS

## Objective

To build a responsive website using HTML and CSS that will showcase my
professional portfolio, which will include the projects i've built, to my professional network.

## Context

As a professional web developer, it’s become essential to have a designated place to
present my work and demonstrate relevant skills such as problem-solving or practical
knowledge in several programming languages and technologies.

As responsive design has become a basic requirement for nearly all web-based
projects, it’s important that my website be responsive and run smoothly on all devices.
The goal of this project is to create a working website, complete with subpages, that
features key information about me as a web developer, relevant work examples, as well as
my contact details.
